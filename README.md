**Extended Kalman Filter**

The goal of this project is to utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements in C++.

## Rubric Points

The [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/748/view) points were individually addressed in the [implementation](https://github.com/velsarav/project-extended-kalman-filter/tree/master/src)

Please refer to the base project [README](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) to compile C++ code and run the simulator.
